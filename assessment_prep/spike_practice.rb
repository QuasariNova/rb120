# Preschool (by Natalie Thompson)
# Inside a preschool there are children, teachers, class assistants, a principle, janitors, and cafeteria workers.
# Both teachers and assistants can help a student with schoolwork and watch them on the playground.
# A teacher teaches and an assistant helps kids with any bathroom emergencies.
# Kids themselves can learn and play.
# A teacher and principle can supervise a class.
# Only the principle has the ability to expel a kid.
# Janitors have the ability to clean.
# Cafeteria workers have the ability to serve food.
# Children, teachers, class assistants, principles, janitors and cafeteria workers all have the ability to eat lunch.
