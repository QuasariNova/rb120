What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.

---

- You can use Encapsulation to hide functionality unneeded by the rest of the program and protect data. It also helps prevent Namespace issues.
- It allows you to think on a new level of abstraction. Objects can be given real world names and methods that decribe the behavior you are trying to represent.
- Polymorphism allows a lot of versatiliy. You can interact with a bunch of kind of data with common interfaces with inhertiance and mixins.
- It allows you to group code with logical containers, making it easier to maintain.
- It allows use to keep our code DRY. Defining functionality used by different parts of the program in one place.
