What is the default return value of to_s when invoked on an object? Where could you go to find out if you want to be sure?

---

The default return value is a string that contains the object's class and the object's id.

You can check the documentation on `Object#to_s` [here](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Object.html#method-i-to_s)
