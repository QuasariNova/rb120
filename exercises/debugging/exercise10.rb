# Example (your output may differ)

puts DoesItRock.find_out('Sushi')       # Sushi seems to be ok...
puts DoesItRock.find_out('Rain')        # Rain is not fun.
puts DoesItRock.find_out('Bug hunting') # Bug hunting rocks!

# In order to test the case when authentication fails, we can simply set
# API_KEY to any string other than the correct key. Now, when using a wrong API
# key, we want our mock search engine to raise an AuthenticationError, and we
# want the find_out method to catch this error and print its error message API
# key is not valid.

# Is this what you expect to happen given the code?

# And why do we always get the following output instead?

# Sushi rocks!
# Rain rocks!
# Bug hunting rocks!
