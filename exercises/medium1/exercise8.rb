# Update this class so you can use it to determine the lowest ranking and
# highest ranking cards in an Array of Card objects:

# class Card
#   attr_reader :rank, :suit

#   def initialize(rank, suit)
#     @rank = rank
#     @suit = suit
#   end
# end

# For this exercise, numeric cards are low cards, ordered from 2 through 10.
# Jacks are higher than 10s, Queens are higher than Jacks, Kings are higher
# than Queens, and Aces are higher than Kings. The suit plays no part in the
# relative ranking of cards.

# If you have two or more cards of the same rank in your list, your min and max
# methods should return one of the matching cards; it doesn't matter which one.

# Besides any methods needed to determine the lowest and highest cards, create
# a #to_s method that returns a String representation of the card, e.g., "Jack
# of Diamonds", "4 of Clubs", etc.

# Examples:

# cards = [Card.new(2, 'Hearts'),
#          Card.new(10, 'Diamonds'),
#          Card.new('Ace', 'Clubs')]
# puts cards
# puts cards.min == Card.new(2, 'Hearts')
# puts cards.max == Card.new('Ace', 'Clubs')

# cards = [Card.new(5, 'Hearts')]
# puts cards.min == Card.new(5, 'Hearts')
# puts cards.max == Card.new(5, 'Hearts')

# cards = [Card.new(4, 'Hearts'),
#          Card.new(4, 'Diamonds'),
#          Card.new(10, 'Clubs')]
# puts cards.min.rank == 4
# puts cards.max == Card.new(10, 'Clubs')

# cards = [Card.new(7, 'Diamonds'),
#          Card.new('Jack', 'Diamonds'),
#          Card.new('Jack', 'Spades')]
# puts cards.min == Card.new(7, 'Diamonds')
# puts cards.max.rank == 'Jack'

# cards = [Card.new(8, 'Diamonds'),
#          Card.new(8, 'Clubs'),
#          Card.new(8, 'Spades')]
# puts cards.min.rank == 8
# puts cards.max.rank == 8

# Output:

# 2 of Hearts
# 10 of Diamonds
# Ace of Clubs
# true
